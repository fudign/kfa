# This directory stores agent execution outputs

Each ADW execution creates a subdirectory with unique ID:
agents/{adw_id}/

These outputs are useful for:
- Debugging failed runs
- Understanding agent decisions
- Tracking execution history
- Performance metrics

Note: Add agents/ to .gitignore if you don't want to commit outputs.
